# OsmiumPy
 Repository for the Osmium Bot in Discord.py, a Python wrapper for the Discord API.

# THIS REPO HAS BEEN "ARCHIVED" FOR THE TIME BEING
  HOWEVER: If a suitable discord.py fork comes along I may switch to it
  I'm aware pycord (the current main fork of discord.py) exists, but I am rewriting my bot in discord.js currently.

## Instructions
 1. Clone Repo to your computer
 2. Install [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installing)
 3. Create a bot in the [Discord Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) Site
 4. Insert Token from the [Discord Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) Site, into the config.json
 5. Run the bot with Python 3.x
